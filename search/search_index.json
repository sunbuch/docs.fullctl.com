It is focused on providing a source of truth for your network and provides a suite of tools to take actions and provide services based on that SoT. In order to provide functionality for a variety of networks, fullCtl is made up of a number of modules. Some of these, like aclCtl, provide functionality to other modules, and some, like ixCtl provide interfaces and automation controllers directly. It should be noted that most modules do not act directly on your infrastructure, instead being communicated with by a variety of agents deployed in your infrastructure. These agents are typically containers providing services like route servers, but can also be proxy connections allowing your systems to securely communicate with fullCtl to obtain and act on information provided by the fullCtl SoT. Why use fullCtl? fullCtl can take the hassle and complexity out of managing a complex infrastructure. Using our modules to track SoT, implement best practices like RPKI and ROAs, and provide backups can give you a leg up on managing your infrastructure in a secure and up to date manner. fullCtl Components aaaCtl - manage your users and access control to various components of fullCtl aclCtl - manage custom ACLs for router configuration ixCtl - manage your IXP users, configure your route servers and as112 systems peerCtl - manage your peering relationships, configurations, and settings for IXs you participate in; allows your IX members to self update when you use ixCtl to manage your infrastructure prefixCtl - enter your network prefixes and irr information to monitor and manage your networks deviceCtl - manage your physical infrastructure, assign ports and logical configurations, and maintain a SoT for easy configuration and monitoring custom Ctl - you can integrate fullCtl\u2019s SoT with your existing workflow or custom code through our rich API, or 20c can create custom integrations for your specific needs About this Documentation fullCtl documentation is divided into two main sections. The first is a series of use case workflow guides to walk you through setting up and implementing common implementations such as an IXP. The second section is a reference guide to the various components and definitions as used by fullCtl. It is recommended that you read through a workflow guide that is appropriate to your use case, then use the reference guide as needed to get further information about the various modules.

It is the centralized authentication service for fullCtl and it contains all RBAC (Role Based Access Control) identity information. You will interact with aaaCtl to add, remove, or change the permissions for all fullCtl users. fullCtl users include anyone or anything that will make network configuration changes. We say anyone or anything because the fullCtl IBN solution will allow applications to make network changes via API, in addition to users making changes via the various SoT GUIs. aclCtl aclCtl is the FullCtl source of truth for access control list (ACL) and network policy information. It is used for managing traffic filtering and device security. aclCtl manages two components; both ACL structure (traffic filtering rules) and the application of those filters. It is expected that ACL structure will change infrequently and that the application of those policies will change more often. For example, if a new service is added to a PoP (Point of Presence) the ACL itself will not change, rather that new service will be added to comply with existing rule-sets. This allows for the automation of service turn up without human intervention. ixCtl ixCtl is an automation platform built for internet exchange operators. Using our member management features, import your existing connected network list from PeeringDB or enter it manually, then use ixCtl to manage MAC addresses, IP addresses, or export as an IX-F connected networks list schema. ixCtl has an open source version designed as a toolkit to enhance flexibility for Internet Exchanges. An IX can run individual components as desired while still allowing for custom, granular integrations with limitless possibilities. ixCtl takes data directly from PeeringDB and combines it with industry best practices to generate (and maintain) secure route server configurations. ixCtl automatically updates route server configurations over time as connected networks update their information. IXCtl is an excellent source of truth for wider automation efforts. When you deploy ixCtl at your IX, all of your connected networks get access to the peerCtl dashboard to automatically update their mac addresses and as-sets directly. peerCtl peerCtl is an automation platform purpose built for busy peering managers. As part of the broader FullCtl IBN solution, peerCtl is the SoT for interconnection and peering. It is used for managing all external BGP sessions with peers and transit providers. peerCtl takes data directly from PeeringDB, combines it with your policies, and generates the complete BGP configuration required to turn up a secure and reliable peering session. peerCtl also provides email templates for each common communication point, along with a workflow to help you turn up new peers. Also, if the IX you\u2019re working with uses ixCtl, you can use peerCtl to update your mac address and as-set. prefixCtl prefixCtl is the fullCtl SoT for prefix sets needed in BGP routing. It is used for managing IRR (Internet Routing Registry) and ROA (Route Origin Authorization) information. This enables third-parties to automatically (or manually) create filters that will always allow your BGP announcements. prefixCtl also provides a reputation monitor, which notifies you any time your address space is reported for abuse (SPAM origination, etc). deviceCtl deviceCtl is a FullCtl SoT designed to manage devices and how they interconnect. deviceCtl is leveraged for instances where Nautobot functionality falls short. Therefore, your implementation may or may not require deviceCtl. When it is present, it is used for all inventory management tasks, to avoid any possible duplication or confusion.","title":"fullCtl Component Overivews"},{"location":"Components/#fullctl-component-overivews","text":"aaaCtl aaaCtl provides centralized authentication, authorization and accounting for fullCtl.

While it\u2019s possible to create an IX without an organization, it\u2019s recommended to use organizations to organize things. Organizations also allow easy segmentation of responsibilities if you have more than one or different people responsible for different IXs, etc. Note that you (and other members of your organization) can use our OAuth support to login with an existing google or PeeringDB account. If you have an existing OAuth authentication infrastructure, you can contact 20c for help integrating it with fullCtl. References - Create Your Login - Create an Organization - Adding Users If you create a user to manage your IX, they will need the following read/write permissions for route server configuration and member management: Internet Exchange Member, Routeserver, Routeserver config. If you are incorporate deviceCtl for infrastructure management and statistics, you will also want: Device, Facility, Logical Port, Physical Port, Virtual Port. Once you have your organization and users setup, click on the ixCtl button under services to proceed to create and configure your IX and services. To populate your IX with its members, you can either import the IX and its current PeeringDB member list or create a new IX and enter members from scratch. It is recommended to use the import method for initial setup, unless you\u2019re starting a new IX in which case you can enter your initial members by hand and then export them to PeeringDB via IX-F export. Import an IX Create a new IX Either way you create your IX, you can add new members, edit existing member information, or remove members from ixCtl. See Add a Member to add a new member or use the edit icon (pencil) to edit an existing member. The trashcan icon will allow you to delete a member. Be aware that once you have an existing IX, you can not re-import from peeringDB without deleting the entire IX and reimporting. Setting up IX-F export is a great way to keep peeringDB in sync and up to date with your local SoT. Once you have your IX created and some members listed, you can create one or more route servers to facilitate multilateral peering. Follow these steps to create your route server(s). You will need to assign IP addresses to the route servers at this time. New route servers are created with basic defaults, to update these to suit your local policies, select Edit for the route server you wish to configure. While ixCtl uses many ARouteServer features, you can use the extra config (yaml) section to add whatever additional configuration you wish. ixCtl updates configurations every 5 minutes, and will indicate when any changes are queued for updates and when the new configuration is ready on the Members tab.Use the Download Configuration button to view the configuration generated by ixCtl and confirm everything is ready to go. You can make updates at any time and they will be incorporated into the configuration during the next update run. You can now set up systems for running ixCtl containers on, as noted in the Prerequisites section. While you can run these containers in kubernetes systems, such setup is beyond the scope of this document. Likewise, non-RedHat based systems can be used as long as they support docker style containers. This guide will focus on RHEL 8 systems using podman, but these instructions should be broadly adaptable to a range of distributions.","title":"Setting up Your Organization in fullCtl"},{"location":"IX%20Admin%20Guide/Setting-up-Org/#setting-up-your-organization-in-fullctl","text":"If you do not already have users and organizations in fullCtl, the first thing you need to do is sign in and create an organization.

References - Create Your Login - Create an Organization - Adding Users If you create a user to manage your IX, they will need the following read/write permissions for route server configuration and member management: Internet Exchange Member, Routeserver, Routeserver config. If you are incorporate deviceCtl for infrastructure management and statistics, you will also want: Device, Facility, Logical Port, Physical Port, Virtual Port. Once you have your organization and users setup, click on the ixCtl button under services to proceed to create and configure your IX and services. To populate your IX with its members, you can either import the IX and its current PeeringDB member list or create a new IX and enter members from scratch. It is recommended to use the import method for initial setup, unless you\u2019re starting a new IX in which case you can enter your initial members by hand and then export them to PeeringDB via IX-F export. Import an IX Create a new IX Either way you create your IX, you can add new members, edit existing member information, or remove members from ixCtl. See Add a Member to add a new member or use the edit icon (pencil) to edit an existing member. The trashcan icon will allow you to delete a member. Be aware that once you have an existing IX, you can not re-import from peeringDB without deleting the entire IX and reimporting. Setting up IX-F export is a great way to keep peeringDB in sync and up to date with your local SoT. Once you have your IX created and some members listed, you can create one or more route servers to facilitate multilateral peering. Follow these steps to create your route server(s). You will need to assign IP addresses to the route servers at this time. New route servers are created with basic defaults, to update these to suit your local policies, select Edit for the route server you wish to configure. While ixCtl uses many ARouteServer features, you can use the extra config (yaml) section to add whatever additional configuration you wish. ixCtl updates configurations every 5 minutes, and will indicate when any changes are queued for updates and when the new configuration is ready on the Members tab.Use the Download Configuration button to view the configuration generated by ixCtl and confirm everything is ready to go. You can make updates at any time and they will be incorporated into the configuration during the next update run. You can now set up systems for running ixCtl containers on, as noted in the Prerequisites section. While you can run these containers in kubernetes systems, such setup is beyond the scope of this document. Likewise, non-RedHat based systems can be used as long as they support docker style containers. This guide will focus on RHEL 8 systems using podman, but these instructions should be broadly adaptable to a range of distributions.","title":"Setting up Your Organization in fullCtl"},{"location":"IX%20Admin%20Guide/Troubleshooting/","text":"Troubleshooting ixCtl route servers are set up to download their configuration to the host system and access it via a shared mount.
